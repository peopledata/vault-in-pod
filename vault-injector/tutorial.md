# Vault Agent Injector Tutorial: Inject Secrets to Pods Using Vault Agent

In this vault agent injector tutorial, I will show you exactly how to use a Hashicorp vault agent configuration to inject agents and render secrets into a kubernetes pod.

I have covered the setup by step guide to implement kubernetes vault agent pods to dynamically retrieve secrets from the vault server

Towards the end of the article, I have added vault agent templating examples using annotations, configmaps, and environment variables.

Also, if you want to understand how pods authenticate to [vault server], refer to this [vault-in-pod guide on Kubernetes].
